Introduction
============

Welcome to the Empathy PHP MVC framework project documentation. 

About The Project
-----------------

PHP is a relatively straightforward programming language, yet since PHP 5.3 and
the introduction of namespaces it has become more sophisticated in the sense
that there are now standards-compliant autoloaders and code that adheres to
them.  This, in essence, makes PHP a more modular language and Empathy seeks to
embrace that and be as interoperable as possible while still making it workable
to support components that aren't. Empathy attempts to be a
straightforward glue-like framework.


Prerequisites
-------------

Empathy needs PHP version 5.3+.


Usage
